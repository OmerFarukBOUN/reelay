# Reelay Monitors

Reelay is a header-only C++ library and set of tools for system-level verification and testing of real-time systems. Reelay implements state-of-the-art [runtime verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification) techniques to construct runtime monitors that check temporal behaviors of the system against system-level requirements. Hence, Reelay can be used to enhance rigorous systems engineering practices by formalizing and automating the assessment phase. 

## Features
* Formal specification of temporal properties
* Provably correct monitor construction from the specification
* Fast and frugal runtime requirement checking (very low overhead)
* Simple but non-restrictive user interface 
* Available for C++, Python, and the command line

## Get Started

The next steps for you are to install Reelay [from source](install.md) or [Docker image](docker.md) and follow through [the tutorial](gs_intro) to learn how to use Reelay monitors from [C++](gs_cpp.md), [Python](gs_python), and the [command line interface](gs_cli.md).

## Contribute

Currently Reelay does not have a contribution guideline. However, we always welcome bug reports, enhancements, and comments regarding the project. Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/doganulus/reelay/issues) page if you have a bug report, enhancement, or comment. Thanks for your interest!
