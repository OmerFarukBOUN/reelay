# Reelay

# Install

Reelay has been designed as a header-only C++ library for full flexibility. The only exception is the expression parser module, which uses files generated by ANTLR parser generator thus needs to be compiled and linked. 

# Getting Started

# Monitoring Apps

Reelay has been designed as a C++ library for full flexibility. Users can write their applications or embed formal specification monitoring into their projects easily. 

We provide a set of online monitoring applications over some common data formats such as comma separated value (CSV) files using Reelay library. The apps folder contains these applications.

# Naming
The name Reelay is originated from the term "relay circuits" as the initial work in the project has been done for translating regular expressions into sequential circuits and thus we are LAY-ing down REs. The extra letter E is helpful in Google searches and also the project has been quickly evolved into other formalisms expressed as regular expressions and else (REE). The name is also a tribute to [A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11173), the master's thesis of my scientific role model Claude E. Shannon.
