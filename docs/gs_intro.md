In this tutorial we will see why and how to use Reelay.

Letâ€™s start with an example from the robotics and suppose that we are designing a home assistant robot as our next product. We also think our customers would love our robots with a door open warning feature!

## Feature: Door Open Warning

So we want to design a feature that warns the user whenever our robot detects the entry door is left open. 

!!! Requirement
    **SYS-REQ-01:** 

Assume that there is one additional requirement that we want to give the warning once as multiple warnings for the same event may annoy our users. 

!!! Requirement
    **SYS-REQ-02:**

## Specify Requirements

## Verify the Execution

Following tutorial will explain how to check these specifications
