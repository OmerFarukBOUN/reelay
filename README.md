Reelay is a header-only C++ library and set of tools for system-level verification and testing of real-time systems. Reelay implements state-of-the-art [runtime verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_verification) techniques to construct runtime monitors that check temporal behaviors of the system against system-level requirements. Hence, Reelay can be used to enhance rigorous systems engineering practices by formalizing and automating the assessment phase. See [the Reelay documentation](https://doganulus.github.io/reelay/) for details.

## Main Features
  * Formal specification of temporal properties
  * Provably correct monitor construction from the specification
  * Fast and frugal runtime requirement checking (very low overhead)
  * Simple but non-restrictive user interface 
  * Available for C++, Python, and the command line

## Get Started

The next steps for you are to install Reelay [from source](docs/install.md) or [Docker image](docs/docker.md) and follow through tutorials to learn how to use Reelay monitors from [C++](docs/gs_cpp.md), [Python](docs/gs_python) and the [command line interface](docs/gs_cli.md).

## Contribute

Currently Reelay does not have a contribution guideline. However, we always welcome bug reports, enhancements, and comments regarding the project. Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/doganulus/reelay/issues) page if you have a bug report, enhancement, or comment. Thanks for your interest!
